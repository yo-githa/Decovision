# Decovision
Decovision is an AI-powered interior design platform that combines machine learning, generative image models, and web technologies to deliver a personalized and accessible home décor experience. The system offers three major capabilities:

AI Room Transformation powered by Stability AI’s image generation API for real-time, high-quality room redesigns.

Style Recommendation Engine that identifies user aesthetic preferences using NLP-based analysis and structured preference mapping.

Furniture Recommendation Chatbot that filters IKEA products through natural-language queries and semantic search.

Built using Flask, SQLite, and open-source AI tools, Decovision prioritizes a lightweight, scalable, and cost-efficient architecture. The platform supports human-centered design by enabling users to convert their décor preferences into actionable design suggestions—regardless of prior design expertise.
